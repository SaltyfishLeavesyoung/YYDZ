“一眼丁真”（pronounced as "Yi Yan Ding Zhen", literally "One Eye Ding Zhen"）is a very popular meme on Chinese social networks.

## The evolution of the meme

Ding Zhen is this guy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_Zhen (and he is despised by most people lol).

"Yi Yan Zhen" ("One eye true") means something is true at first sight.

However it can also be sarcastic (on the Internet) and means something is fake at first sight.

The "Zhen" in Ding Zhen's name is exactly the same character.

Therefore people begin to use "Yi Yan Ding Zhen" ("One eye Ding Zhen") for extra sarcasm, because someone said "Ding Zhen has pure eyes", and pure is "Chun Zhen" in Chinese, with the same character "Zhen".

Now consider a YYDZ meme sample:

The Chinese reads:
```
One Salt Ding Zhen
Appraised as: Iodine
```

"One Salt" is "Yi1 Yan2" in Chinese, which sounds similar to "One Eye" (Yi1 Yan3). All these images are playing around with the "Yi1 Yan3" sound in the first part.

"Appraised as" is another meme.

"Iodine" is "Dian3" in Chinese, which sounds the same as "Classic" (Dian3), which is related to yet another meme ("Classic in Classic" = shitty).

So all these images are both puns and connecting various memes.

And hence they are funny to all who spent too much time on the Internet, and they become extremely popular.
